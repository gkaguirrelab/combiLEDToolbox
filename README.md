# combiLEDToolbox
This is a set of routines that support the use of a Prizmatix CombiLED light engine (https://www.prizmatix.com/FC/CombiLED.htm).

Custom Arduino firmware provides a device API. The Matlab routines include object-oriented code for control and calibration of the device. Additional routines provide an interface to the Silent Substitution toolbox for the creation of photoreceptor directed modulations using the device.
