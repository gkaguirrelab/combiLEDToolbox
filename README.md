# combiLEDToolbox
This is a set of routines that support the use of a Prizmatix CombiLED light engine (https://www.prizmatix.com/FC/CombiLED.htm).

Custom Arduino firmware provides a device API. The Matlab routines include object-oriented code for control and calibration of the device. Additional routines provide an interface to the Silent Substitution toolbox for the creation of photoreceptor directed modulations using the device. 

Included are routines for calibration of the device, and for the generation of device settings to target photoreceptor classes using the "silent substitution" approach.
