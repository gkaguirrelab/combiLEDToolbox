The rodent action spectra CSV file was downloaded from:

	https://github.com/PySilentSubstitution/pysilsub/blob/main/pysilsub/data/rodent_action_spectra.csv

on May 17, 2023.

We believe that these values derive from those reported by Rob Lucas and colleagues. The data had previously been hosted on his personal website (https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/robert.lucas/), but no longer seems available there.

The relevant references is:

*** PrizmatixLED8Set_A.csv ***

A set of 8 LEDs that were selected after brute-force search over all combinations of the LEDs in the PrizmatixLEDFullSet.csv, with the choice guided by maximizing contrast for a set of modulations.

The specific spectra in here are after the LEDs pass through the set of dichroic filters that are illustrated in the schematic PDF and listed on this webpage.
